- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @faaiqgwaqar. (He/Him)
- :mortar_board: I am an Electrical Engineering Ph.D. Student (with a Minor in Physics) at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I graduated with my B.Sc. in Computer Science & Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Minor in Mathematics from Oregon State University in 2022
- :printer: I've spent time in the industry working on SoCs at Microsoft, Arm and Intel.
- :test_tube: I currently work on research concerning the integration of emerging materials and devices in novel computing paradigms (Advised by Dr. Shimeng Yu). As an undergraduate, I researched ways in which we could leverage deep learning techniques to accelerate the discovery of nano-porous materials (Co-Advised by Dr. Cory Simon and Dr. Xiaoli Fern).
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in device physics, heterogeneous and monolithic integration of 3D integrated circuits, high performance computer architecture, deep learning, and pedagogy.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via. email (faaiq.waqar@gmail.com) for any questions!
